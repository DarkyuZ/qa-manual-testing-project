- Error message behavior verification  


# Bug Reporting Process

Each reported defect includes:

- Unique Bug ID  
- Environment information  
- Clear reproduction steps  
- Expected vs Actual results  
- Severity and Priority classification  
- Status tracking  

This follows standard industry bug documentation practices.
