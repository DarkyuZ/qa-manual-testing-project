Manual QA Testing Portfolio Project

 Overview

This repository contains a practical Manual Quality Assurance (QA) project focused on functional testing, negative testing scenarios, and structured bug reporting.  
The project simulates real-world QA documentation used in professional software testing environments.

It demonstrates my ability to design test cases, execute manual test scenarios, identify defects, and document findings following industry standards.



# Project Objectives

- Design structured manual test cases  
- Perform positive and negative testing scenarios  
- Identify and document software defects  
- Practice real QA documentation workflow  
- Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration simulation  



## Scope of Testing

The testing scope focuses on a simulated login functionality including:

- Valid login scenarios  
- Invalid credential handling  
- Input validation  
- Error message behavior  
- User experience related issues  




Test Artifacts Included

### Test Cases

- Positive Login Test Case  
- Negative Login Test Case (invalid credentials, empty fields, incorrect formats)  

#### Bug Reports

- Bug 001: Generic login error message does not specify incorrect field  
- Bug 002: Validation or usability issue detected during testing  

Each document follows a professional QA documentation structure including:

- Preconditions  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected results  
- Actual results  
- Severity classification  



## Tools and Technologies Used

- Manual Testing Methodology  
- Visual Studio Code
